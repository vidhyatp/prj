QA Automation Project
I have done the QA Assignment in Selenium Webdriver and the UI used is eclipse. 
There is a test suite named auto in which I have created testclasses for successful registration(successreg), showing errors when registraton is not complete(verify) and for the checkout(checkout).
You can run the script by right clicking on each classes and running as either java application or run as server.
