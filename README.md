QA Automation Project

I have done the QA Assignment in Selenium Webdriver and the UI used is eclipse. 
There is a test suite named auto in which I have created testclasses for successful registration(successreg), showing errors when registraton is not complete(verify) and for the checkout(checkout) for the product.
You can run the script by right clicking on each classes and running as either java application or run as server.

1. Verify( the test class when registration is not complete)

I have imported some libraries for selenium.
wrote all the find elements in the main function and made assumptions for email,name ,password,address and checked if there is an alert box when some fields are missing

2. successreg(For the successful registration)

The find elements are mentioned in the main function and the complete fileds are filled making sure the registration is successful.

3. Checkout

The whole checkout is joined in single test class. The assumptions made are the user is already logged in during the check out process and the order history can be seen in the end
